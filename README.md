# Proactive Social Distancing Java Application
This is a Java application that determines the number of people allowed in a building at one time based on social distancing guidelines (2m distance). A person should be allowed to enter a location only if the maximum capacity of that location has not reached. After entering into a location, the app determines whether or not a
person is too close to another. It can also determine if the person is in a close contact of a Covid patient and set their status to casual contact.

Includes:
1. Location database of different locations, with some associated data
2. Entry allowance or disallowance based on current visitors
3. Dynamic social distancing inside of a building, creating social bubble, and
determining close contacts and casual contacts
